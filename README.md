# fsecure_car

Greetings, dear judges

My Mobile application is based on the implementation of car theft security system which uses facial recognition model to check the authenticity of a person driving the car.
This technique allows user (owner of the car) to register his face in the database.


Whenever a face other than the owner's face is detected, the screenshot is sent to the owner and if he approves the screnshot (this might be the case that he/she is their family member), then the user is approves otherwise in case of any anonymous face inside the car, the owner can enable a buzzer from the app itself which would buzz in the car indicating to a possible theft in progress.
